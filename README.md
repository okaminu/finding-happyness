# Finding Happy(ness)
Since the announced GameJam theme was "Lost and Found", we developed a game where you control a character that loses senses and happiness when your dog is missing and it's your task to recover your sense of vision, space and sound by finding memories of your dog in backyard. Developed for GameJam 2021 hackaton 

Developed on Unity 2019.4.1 with C#
